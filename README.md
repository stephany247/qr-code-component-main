## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

During this project, I learned several key concepts and practices in web development.
.
-Flexbox for Layout: I gained experience using Flexbox for centering elements within a container. This made it simpler to create responsive designs and maintain consistent spacing.

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```


-CSS Custom Properties: Using CSS variables allowed for a more manageable approach to styling. I found it particularly helpful for maintaining a consistent color scheme across the component.

```css
:root {
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
}
```


-Mobile-First Workflow: I embraced a mobile-first approach to design, which led me to consider usability on smaller screens first. This experience reinforced the importance of responsive design practices.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to focus on the following areas:

- Responsive Design: I aim to refine my skills in creating layouts that adapt seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a better user experience.

- CSS Grid: While I have used flexbox effectively, I want to deepen my understanding of CSS Grid for more complex layouts and improve my ability to design intricate web pages.

- Accessibility Best Practices: I want to ensure that my projects are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Learning and implementing best practices for accessibility will be a key focus.

- Performance Optimization: I intend to learn techniques to optimize web performance, including lazy loading, code splitting, and minimizing asset sizes to enhance load times and overall user experience.


### Useful resources

-[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) - The challenges on this platform have been instrumental in improving my coding skills. They offer real-world projects that simulate professional development scenarios.

-[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - I found this site useful for quick references and tutorials, especially for CSS properties and JavaScript functions. Itâ€™s a great starting point for beginners.
